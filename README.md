# selforg-hexapod
Hexapod locomotion via a dynamical systems approach, using 'ArcBotics Hexy' and 'Servotor32'.

The original code from
https://github.com/ArcBotics/Servotor32
was modified by an editing and addition of the lines 425-1179 and the functions 'update_all_registers_fast' and 'sendToPC' in Servotor32.cpp.
